# Algorithm
Collection of self made common algorithm implementation. The purpose of this project is just for fun and practice. I implemented the algorithm after trying to understand the theoritical concept of it (and 5 years after I finished data structure and algorithm class).

The code might not be the most efficient one as I haven't compare it with the best case example code available yet. I just develop this project for a fun escape from my business courses (yes, I take many business courses in CMU!). Will try to improve the efficiency if I have time. lol.
